We choose two environments to explore by the various agents.  The
first environment is a 3x4 grid-world and the second is a 4x6
grid-world.  All states, unless the state is a sink state, will share
a default reward that we will vary.  There will be two sink states -
the final goal state with a high reward, placed far from the initial
state, and an "temptation" award, which has an intermediate value, but
is closer to the initial state than the final goal.  The motivation is
to explore how varying the parameters of the problem will affect the
agent, to see what biases the agent to falling for the closer
temptation versus travelling the full distance to the final reward.

Our first experiment is to employ value iteration and policy iteration.  We also vary the non-
